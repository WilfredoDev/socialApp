# Sociopedia

This social media application is built using the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, with state management handled by Redux. The app allows users to create profiles, post updates, comment on posts, and follow other users. It features real-time notifications, a responsive design for seamless use across devices, and robust user authentication and authorization. The backend, powered by Express and Node.js, ensures efficient data handling and scalability, while the frontend, developed with React and Redux, provides a dynamic and smooth user experience.
